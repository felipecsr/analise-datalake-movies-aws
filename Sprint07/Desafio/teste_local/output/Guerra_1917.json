The gown so transforms her that, in honor of their wedding anniversary, Reyton buys three ambulances for France. Mrs. Reyton then sends the gown to her cousin Natalie.

In France, Neil proves himself a hero and, while leading an attack on a German stronghold, saves Andre's father, the mayor of the town, from death.

Juli becomes Juliette, and soon we can see her again on the Tashkent property of a prince, where she lives in luxury. In the meantime, war breaks out. Prisoners are brought into the castle. Juli discovers her own father among them, but he does not forgive her for bringing shame on him. One day, as the exchanged prisoners set off for their homeland in the morning fog, Juliette dresses up in the old clothes of Juli, braids her hair and leaves everything, riches and love behind, to return to the land, which her soul became a prisoner of in the very moment she was born .",

The footage depicts a relatively high-spirited mood, considering how the Dutch military had mobilized but not actually participated in the war.  Precisely who it was that needed to be convinced of the solid foundation of Dutch neutrality is shown clearly in a folder that accompanied the screening of this film at the Residentie cinema in The Hague: ‘The purpose of the film is to impress upon the Dutch people (…) that our military forces, with the resources at their disposal, can readily be compared to those of the foreign military forces.’ The term ‘impress upon’ can be taken literally: people needed to be put at ease.",
