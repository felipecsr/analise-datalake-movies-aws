Jefferson is court-martialed, but King Albert of Belgium, who has befriended little Jacques, intercedes on his behalf.

She is flattered by his attentions and their friendship soon blossoms into love.\r However German plotters plan to destroy an arsenal at night and Sir Roger is inveigled into driving an automobile along a London road with its lights turned skyward to guide the Zeppelins. Jim, wounded and home on furlough, detects Sir Roger on the lonely road, follows and traps him in his cottage. Sir Roger turns his pistol on himself rather than be taken alive.
