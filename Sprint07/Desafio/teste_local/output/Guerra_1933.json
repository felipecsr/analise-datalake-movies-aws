It became a symbol of the new times touted by the Nazi regime.  The title (literally \"morning-red\") is the German term for the reddish coloring of the east sky about a half hour before the sunrise.  On patrol Captain Liers and his submarine crew sink an important British ship, but while returning to harbour, they're lured into a trap by a British vessel disguised as a neutral Danish one. They sink it after it attacks them without warning, but  while they prepare to rescue survivors, a British destroyer sinks the sub.  On the sea bed 60 feet down, with all but the bridge flooded, the 10 surviving crew have only 8 rescue devices. Liers orders the crew to use them, but they disobey - either all escape or nobody does.",

Courtney returns to the outpost ahead of time and the wife takes refuge in the quarters of Lieutenant W.B. Lawrence. Lawrence, maintaining the silence (and stiff upper lip) that his code of honor dictates is drummed out of the service. He joins the forces of El Rahman and becomes a sheik of the desert. Warfare, instigated by Randall, breaks out between the troops and the tribesmen and ends when the mortally wounded Randall confesses to his dastardly deeds, the least of which included making love to his commander's wife.",

WWI breaks soon after the departure. By and by the ship’s company gets worn down by dead calm. On account of the plague-ridden captain, Wiggen disposes of the contaminated water reserve. Discontent among the crew rises until they take the sole lifeboat and leave their mate behind. Wiggen unsuccessfully tries to bring the ship under control. At the last minute he is rescued off the Japanese coast. At his return he promises to never leave his wife and child again.  But the German Imperial Navy begins to blockade the waterways of the island. Wiggen paddles to Sweden with the intention of smuggling provisions for his family. On his way back he is detained by a German captain. After five years of imprisonment he returns to Muhu once more.  Wiggen is hellbent on vengeance. (Deutsche Kinemathek)",

The young lovers in rural China are framed by their evil landlord. The man is sent to prison; the woman is forced to get married. She tries to seek revenge but is killed. When the man is released from prison, he joins the People's Volunteer Army but is killed in battle. The film was significant in its time. Runje Shaw had imported advanced American audio film equipment and technology in 1931, making this one of the first sound films in China. As one of Unique's few ‘progress' films, it also reflects that this ‘entertainment-only', apolitical film company, under the left-wing influences in society, also needed to make films with topics such as the war effort and that criticise the bourgeoisie. Struggle is a joint effort among the best of talents in front of and behind the camera, and is also the only surviving work of director Qiu Qixiang.",
