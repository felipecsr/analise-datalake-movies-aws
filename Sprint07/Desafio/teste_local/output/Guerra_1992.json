After submitting his entry, under his bardic name \"Hedd Wyn\" (\"Blessed Peace\") Evans later departs from Meirionydd by train to join the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in Liverpool, despite his initial misgivings about the war. Ellis  is sent to fight in the trenches of Flanders.  'Hedd Wyn' was the first Welsh-language film to be nominated for an Oscar.",

Like thousands of other Japanese Canadians, Minoru and his family were branded as an enemy of Canada, dispatched to internment camps in the interior of British Columbia, and finally deported to Japan. Directed by Michael Fukushima, Minoru's son, the film artfully combines classical animation with archival material. The memories of the father are interspersed with the voice of the son, weaving a tale of suffering and survival, of a birthright lost and recovered.",

Ivan Salaj, a young and gifted director who was still enrolled in film  school at the time, chooses to use their story as the subject of his student film. Considered one of the most important films  from a period when Croatian independence was still at stake, it provides an accurate portrayal of life on the front lines.  What makes Hotel Sunja even more special is that it was made by a group of students who risked their lives to make the  movie.",
