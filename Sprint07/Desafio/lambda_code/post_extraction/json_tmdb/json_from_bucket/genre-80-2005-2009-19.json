They each have to struggle with the question of relationships and loyalties, amidst a backdrop of urban decay and powerlessness. Are they prepared to give up what's comfortable for new possibilities? Where has Meor been all this time? And why is there a gun in his bag?",

The film is an eclectic, multi-authored impression of Dublin (within the bounds of the encircling M50 motorway) as it lived, died, breathed, made love, filled up and emptied, consumed, wept, was rained and shone upon, grew bright and then darkened again.",

As he uncovers the circumstances of his father's death, Jake enlists the help of the daughter of a man his father killed, and fends off the town's brutal sheriff. But Jake isn't the only one looking to haul away the money. Escaped from prison, and on the run, Jake's father's surviving partner in crime shows up in town to finally collect his ill-gotten gains. The sheriff, the outlaw, the locals and the girl go straight to what they know-the gun-and Jake, caught in the crossfire, must decide who's side he is on.",

As the case is still unsolved as of today, the story still lives on in the minds of the people. Motion pictures, theatre plays, and the bestselling novel “Tannöd”, behind all of them stands Hinterkaifeck.\r Aspiring police investigators and a self-declared “Internet – special commission ‘Hinterkaifeck’” have now once again taken up the trail of the case. This exciting search for traces is followed by the film, and its findings are recreated in elaborate play scenes. Thereby, a picture of an era thought to be bygone and an idea of what really happened back then comes into existence.\r More precise than any fiction, the docudrama manages to get closer to the truth.",
