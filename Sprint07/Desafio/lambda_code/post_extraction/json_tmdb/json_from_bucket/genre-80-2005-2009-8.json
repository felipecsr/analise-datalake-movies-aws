A TV crew on assignment in the area happens to capture this humiliation on camera, and this example of police incompetence is soon the lead story in every news bulletin. Public confidence in law and order now suffers irreparable harm. The head of the Moscow force welcomes a public search-and-destroy operation against these thugs, the brainchild of Katya, his PR director. She proposes that the capture of this dangerous gang be transformed into a live TV show of a kind never seen before. At this point she cannot know that the gang leader's life-and-death struggle with the police is destined to lead to a media duel. Besieged in a huge apartment block, the crooks hold hostage a father and his son and daughter. A massive special forces rescue operation is mounted but fails miserably.",

Now a retiring millionaire, she’s distributed most of her wealth among her children and is enjoying her life as an independent, tech-savvy granny. A band of less-than-professional criminals kidnaps her in a hope to make an easy fortune but their naïve plan goes all wrong, when the family of their difficult hostage is reluctant to pay the modest ransom of 50,000 dollars. Infuriated by this, Mrs. KWON takes the matter into her own hands and leads the pack in making the biggest kidnap case in history.

Now, as Megan re-opens the case, she quickly unearths a mystery long since buried and uncovers a secret which has her in danger of losing her career, her relationship and possibly…her life.",
