From there the story shifts gears when a Senator's secretary seeks out Rapeman's services to rape his fiancé who has been brainwashed by a local cult.

This back-fires when the cult does not ex-communicate her - so Keisuke and Uncle infiltrate the cult to get to the bottom of their shady dealings. The resulting investigation embroils the duo in a conspiracy between the cult and a sleazy politician that can only be \"righted through penetration\"...",
