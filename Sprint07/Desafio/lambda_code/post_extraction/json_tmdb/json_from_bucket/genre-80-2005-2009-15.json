The post-Soviet Caucasus have turned into one large conflict zone. Two radically different people with different ideals, problems, and goals are united by the conflict zone. Gogliko, a Tbilisi street boy, and Spartak, a Sukhumi sniper, are forced to solve problems of the street and problems of the state together. For one, the goal is to get back the money he lost gambling; for the other, it is to carry out a general's absurd military mission. In spite of it all, their paths cross and their lives are changed forever.",

The favorite entertainment of the Russian Colonel in charge of the prison was to have the inmates play Russian Roulette. Only his unbelievable luck and survivor spirit helped Moldovan live through his detention. Out of the prison the ex-policeman joins an international Russian Roulette illegal gaming circuit. In late 70's faith brings him to a Central European town where Goldberg, an old acquaintance of his is organizing an \"improved\" version of the game where two opponents are shooting each other. Step by step Moldovan meets lots of familiar faces, both friends and enemies. It looks like the whole Bucharest's underworld from the 40's chose to meet here.",

Only one of them survived the ordeal of CANNIBAL. From a hospital bed, an injured Noelle tells shocked police detectives a tale of cannibal terror. In recounting her ordeal, the detectives learn of an even more awful truth behind the actions of this tragic couple. Horror master Ulli Lommel's depraved tale of a modern-day CANNIBAL is based on the real-life case of a man who murdered and consumed his lover -- liver and all! -- in a strange act of consensual love. In Lommel's film of the events, two star-crossed lovers enter a world where madness rules and even a loved one can transform into a flesh-eating cannibal.",
