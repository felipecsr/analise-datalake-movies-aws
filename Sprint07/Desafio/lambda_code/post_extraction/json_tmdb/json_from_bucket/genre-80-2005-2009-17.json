In the same second, bandits appear from nowhere and attack the passengers of a brand new foreign car. In an unequal battle, Marina dies, and Andrei is seriously injured.  The hero still finds the strength to get to the nearest police station to report a crime. But the first who catches his eye is Malkov himself. Realizing that all efforts are in vain, Andrei leaves. However, the bandits are already aware of the surviving witness of the attack on the road, and they begin to hunt for the officer. Now he is alone against the whole gang.",

While reading his favorite Mickey Spillane book, he falls asleep and dreams of a helpless girl in dire need of a hero. In his dream, he becomes the mighty John Baretta who looks danger in the eye and laughs. When he wakes, he finds a note in his book that says, \"Remember me. They're gonna die. See me. Help me.\" Johnny sets out on a quest to find the dire maiden in his dream and save her from a criminal's grip. The story juxtaposes Johnny's actual blunder of an adventure with what he envisions in his mind to be this great caper that will prove he can be the stoic hero of the books he reads. Let's just hope Johnny can live up to the hype of his own mental status.",
