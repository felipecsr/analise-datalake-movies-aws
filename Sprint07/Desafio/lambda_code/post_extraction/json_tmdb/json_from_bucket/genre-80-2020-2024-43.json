Depicted as an ungrateful junkie who recklessly destroyed her first transplant, Wild Butterfly investigates the true story behind the events that lead to Claire's death in 2010 including new criminal evidence. Catholic institutional cover-up, medical negligence, missing police records, and trial by mainstream and social media, are all at play in this heartbreaking and gripping documentary.  This is not just the tragic story of one young woman and her family - this story opens our eyes to the impacts of universal social injustices and prejudices, that could befall any family and anybody's daughter.",

The scenes in TYICKOOUNS are an irony. The TYICKOOUNS series begins in Siem Pang village which is a remote village occupied by groups that have been exiled and isolated by the community. The title of this village, 'Siem Pang', is derived from the name of a former Communist prisoner who escaped from prison and hid in the village and finally disappeared.  The scenario in Siem Pang includes children being left out of school, teenagers being free without trust, parents not knowing the validity of their marriages, young people being increasingly rude and active with gangs until the Baha Tycoon comes with his forces from Bandar Besar Pongga including Cikgu Gadak wants to change the fate of the villagers. The change brought about by the Baha Tycoon was unpopular with some who eventually led to his assassination.",
