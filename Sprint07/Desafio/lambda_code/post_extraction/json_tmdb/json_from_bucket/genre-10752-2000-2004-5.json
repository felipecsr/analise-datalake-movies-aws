The Blitzkrieg had begun, an entirely new way of fighting war. For the young men aged 18 and 19 who joined up to 'do their bit', it was a terrifying baptism of fire, and for the British Army a shattering blow. Within three weeks, it was a crushing defeat, leading to the largest military evacuation in history.  This film is the story, told in their own words, of a group of young men, now veterans, and their first experience of modern mechanised warfare.",

While engaged in a ferocious dog fight with the Germans over northern France he was seen heading into heavy cloud cover with his machine guns blazing. That was the last time anyone ever saw him alive.  Official German records claim that Lothar Von Richtoffen, brother of the Red Baron, shot Ball down but this was never officially confirmed and remains a mystery of the war.",

The director tells a forgotten part of history through the lives and testimonies of the survivors. It is a record of the scars of war that can never be erased, in line with the twisted modern history: Before even properly apologizing for the massacre of Vietnamese civilians caused by the dispatch of South Korean troops to Vietnam in the past, the government dispatched troops to Iraq again. - Mad Minutes: \"To soothe the boredom of American soldiers dispatched to Vietnam during the war, we give them 2-3 minutes once every two months to allow them to freely shoot at anything other than the target inside the unit.\"",
