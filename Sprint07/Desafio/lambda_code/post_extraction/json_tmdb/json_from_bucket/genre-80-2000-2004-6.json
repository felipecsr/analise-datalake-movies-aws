        "overview": "Rimini, 1991. For more than a year, the uno bianca gang - they always use a white Fiat Uno - has plagued the area. Their crimes are violent, sometimes killing carabineri, and there's no particular pattern: a bank one day, a petrol station the next, extortion of a small business the next. Are they terrorists? A foreign gang? Tied to the Mafia? After a particularly bloody shootout, two detectives are assigned to start fresh: they go through the notebooks of previous investigators and they interview a few witnesses again. They find a pattern in the crimes and predict the next assault, but the special task force in Bologna is dismissive. Can they carry on alone; how far will they get?",

        "overview": "Denis Hopkins, a pilot, lives with his pregnant wife Valerie and has a comfortable lifestyle. When a gang of criminals led by the sadistic Ricky Barnes breaks into his home, he offers whatever the criminals want to protect his wife and unborn child, but the evil Ricky kills Valerie anyway. Their baby is saved, and later Barnes is arrested and sentenced to life in the maximum security prison, Sullen Voe. Denis fakes his own suicide, then assaults a police car in order to get himself arrested and sent to prison with the intention of tracking down and killing Ricky Barnes. He does not reveal his true name and is called John \"What\" by the prisoners and guards. Denis escapes from successive prisons, forcing his eventual transfer to Sullen Voe. When he reaches his objective, Ricky Barnes schedules a confrontation, but things do not quite turn out the way Denis had expected.",

Their evil nemesis Wall-Enberg are planning to steal billions of euros of the European Union's grants to culture.

Each killing was captured on video and Dr. Q uploads them on to the internet shortly after each body is discovered. In between busting the usual roster of thugs and lowlifes, reckless young cop Bong and his more collected, middle-aged partner, Na, work on the case but clash with their S.T.F. counterparts, Lt. Pyo and computer whiz Kang. Pyo discovers a bug in the S.T.F. headquarters but asks Kang to keep this a secret for the time being. Further suspicious acts on Pyo’s part leave Kang uncertain of his loyalty. Bong and Na, meanwhile, are assigned to work directly with S.T.F, leading to several clashes between Bong and Pyo, whose styles could not be more different. All leads point to The Ilsim Ring, a clandestine assassination squad apparently made of up of high ranking law enforcement officials.",

He learns he has a disease that will soon kill him painfully, so he hires a stranger to arrange his own death. With one eye on the calendar (he's allowed a few days' grace before his murder), he pursues a final case, the serial killing of young women. Emmett develops a profile of the assailant. Meanwhile, his fixer hires an ex-cop to kill Emmett, a lonely security guard whom the fixer taunts and belittles. In this limited time, can Emmett sort out what's important?",

However, he soon comes to the realization that his innocence means less than how much bribe money he’s able to come up with for his release. It becomes apparent that Kohei is going to have to get to know his fellow inmates a little better, as he’s obviously in this situation for the long haul; but meeting a female inmate from a nearby jail certainly makes his transition to the criminal life a little easier to take.",
