Two Irish drug dealers, Jacko and his much-maligned sidekick Niallser, drag a captured cockney rival into an abandoned shed in the depths of rural Ireland. A stash of cocaine has gone missing, supplies are running low, and Jacko has his mind set on who is responsible. Things don't look good for Andy, the prisoner from London. Especially since the vengeful Jacko has a mighty bone to pick with the English. One that goes all the way back to the Famine. The interrogation spirals into a fiercely nationalistic debate about Anglo-Irish history, increasing the threat that something truly terrible is going to happen. Set in an isolated shed, our three characters play out this absurd scene in real time. The result is a short film full of playful humour and hard-hitting historical facts.",

There was no sexual violence involved and since the local doctors thought that there was not enough blood on the crime scene, everyone jumped to the conclusion that Jews must have killed her and added her blood to their passover matzot. There was a potential murderer at hand too - a cheeky, not very bright young Jewish rover, Leopold Hilsner…",

Beatrice Gibson’s adaptation, set almost a century later in contemporary Paris, deploys Stein’s script as a talismanic guide through a contemporary moment of comparable social and political unrest. An original soundtrack, written especially for the film by British composer Laurence Crane, responds to the repetition, duplication and duality at play in Stein’s script. Both a fictional thriller and an act of collective representation, Deux Soeurs proposes empathy and friendship as means to reckon with an increasingly turbulent present.",
