Moloss is his name and he’s got a mission: to cure the world of a very human disease. But his method could not differ more from those of Gandhi or Mother Theresa. He’s certainly not turning the other cheek. His approach is a lot more direct, not to say radical. His very personal spin on the tactic of the scorched earth to make way for a better future implicates not only his daughter Doianna and his ex-wife Veronica, but many others who didn’t plan any revolution. Is he out of his mind? Desperate? Dangerous? Perhaps all three, but in his defense, it’s our society that has started it!",

        "overview": "Peter Moore, the murderer known as the 'man in black', has now served 25 years in prison. Back in 1995, he terrorised communities along the north Wales coastline, killing four men and allegedly attacking many more. By day he was a well-respected shopkeeper and cinema owner in Kinmel Bay, and by night he was a sadistic killer who seemed to target gay men.  In this special edition of Dark Land, former chief constable Jackie Roberts returns to re-examine the hunt for the man who would go down in history as Wales’s worst serial killer.  Moore is revealed as a man with a violent secret life, hiding in plain sight. Beneath the façade of a respectable businessman was a mind warped by a dysfunctional upbringing; a man who seized upon a climate of gay prejudice to embark upon a 20-year spree of savage attacks, confident his victims wouldn’t feel able to come forward to complain.  The ultimate question is, could Moore have been stopped before he went on to kill and kill again?",

The engineering and structural failures that caused the collapse of a bridge that stood for over a decade, also took down the most luxurious train of the day, “The Pacific Express #5.” The accident happened in Ashtabula, Ohio on December 29, 1876 during a raging blizzard, sending the luxury train crashing 70-feet into a river gorge and costing the lives of 97 people. The disaster shocked the nation, yet it’s a story that’s been lost in the pages of history.  In a strange twist of fate and intrigue, the bridge disaster also became the backdrop to the still unsolved murder of Charles Collins, the railroad’s chief engineer. It also contributed to the eventual suicide of millionaire Amasa Stone, the president of the railroad and the designer and builder of the bridge.",
