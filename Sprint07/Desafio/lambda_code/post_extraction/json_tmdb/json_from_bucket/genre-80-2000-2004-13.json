The brothers spend their time watching TV, while Jo rereads Leonard Cohen's novel \"Beautiful Losers\" and attends writing classes. Luka, a Czech immigrant, picks up Jo when he sees her shoplifting. When Johnny surprises Luka kissing Jo, he attacks him. In the ensuing fight Jo accidentally kills Johnny, and Luka leaves the scene, but drops his wallet. The police assume that Luka attacked Johnny after a break-in and Jo goes along with that, but feels guilty about it.",

Fatso told Hon that a gang of seven criminals with heavy firearms was planning to rob a factory. To be safe, Ann ordered the SDU to standby for any emergency. The assault team successfully shot or captured five gangsters after their robbery. While they were celebrating their success, the remaining two gangsters returned and opened fire on them. The SDU then stepped in and killed the two gangsters. Madam So had no choice but to shelve the idea of an assault team and approved the new SDU budget proposed by Stone.",
