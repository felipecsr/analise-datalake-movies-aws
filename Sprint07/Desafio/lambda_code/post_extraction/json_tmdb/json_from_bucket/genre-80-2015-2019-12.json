In charge of the investigation is Captain Zhou (Tony Leung Ka Fai), a dedicated cop who's dragging along his teenage daughter Xinyi (Zhou Dongyu). Soon he's joined by Wang Hao (Tong Dawei) a young Shanghai detective who's on a missing person case that has led him to the same village where the murders happened. The two cases prove to be connected: the missing person and the two victims were part of a quartet of businessmen who ten years ago opened a refinery in the region, and disposed of chemical waste in an unethical way that has poisoned the waters and led to malformed babies in the following decade. Is the missing businessman the killer, the next victim or a red herring?",

Grandfather, half-brother, monks, nuns... one after another, people related to the family are murdered. Yet, the truth remains elusive. In the midst of this, Tatsuya stumbles into a massive cave system. What he sees there is a wax figure of the head of the Terada family wearing the samurai armor. Meanwhile, Kindaichi, who has uncovered the secret of Tatsuya's birth, finds himself at the same cave. At that very moment, Tatsuya is cornered deep within the cave by villagers who fear the curse.",

This can cause some interesting and sometimes lethal side-effects whenever her clients are in the heat of passion. In other words, you do not want to mess with Soo-na. Now she has a new client, Ji-soon, who is very persistent in wanting her to use the stitchery tattoo technique. Soo-na gives in and agrees to finish the tattoo of a Medusa on his back. She quickly learns that behind the Medusa lies a dark secret that has ties to her own past. What follows is a tale of revenge, murder, and tattoos.",
