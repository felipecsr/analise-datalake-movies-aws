When unexplained incidents happen, followed by a murder in Roxana's entourage, she starts to wonder whether her new hands may be committing crimes of which she's unaware. Police Capitain Almeida, in charge of the investigation, falls in love with Roxana, but she remains the prime suspect. Is it possible that Roxana's hands are urging Roxana to do terrible things she's not even conscious of? Or is she the victim of some terrible plot?",

Marco contacts Raul Chinna, a well-known criminologist that has made the Dog's bloody legacy his very own field of expertise. As soon Marco and Chinna start to recall the past, they both have to face the fact there is another man obsessed by the murders of Crazy Dog: David Moiraghi, a journalist who's been working for decades on the serial killer. As the truth starts slowly to emerge from the mists of time, Marco has to acknowledge that there is maybe something more that links professor Chinna and Moiraghi. The thin line between truth and fiction starts slowly to blur while Marco is forced once again to face his worst nightmares all over again.",

CHARM is an ultra low budget black comedy about Malcolm - a New Yorker who gets tired of how gentrified, tepid and antiseptic it's all become. What's happened to the 'Good ole days'?! And so he decides to take matters into his own hands by personally starting a crime wave which he hopes will catch on and drive real estate value down, opening up the city to bohemians, artists and a swell of creativity, just like the supposed good 'ole days of the 1970s and 80s. The only problem is: Nobody is paying attention.",
