But the police are close behind, impatient and trigger-happy.",

They have come to the hotel as all of them are going to sue David over his new book - \"The Resort\" which characters are obviously based on Jordan and the guests.

While Perry and Della try to solve the main mystery, Paul tries to find out who is trying to scare Susan away from the hotel. Could it really be a ghost or a more earthy visitor?",
