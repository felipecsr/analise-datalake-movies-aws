Through a friend from the secret service, he finds out the mission was an unofficial one and that Goran and the others were acting as mercenaries. Ilija begins to expose a network of illegal activity involving not only the military, but high-ranking officials. As the investigation becomes more dangerous, his original intention to find out the truth slowly turns into a pathological mission of vengeance.",

Desperate for a proper burial, he pleads with the reluctant Friar for blessing, leading to a disagreement and Dagohoy's injury. A kind villager found Dagohoy helplessly and tended his wound. Afterwards, a 'spirit' visited Dagohoy in his dream. The following day, they seek Tamblot, a male Babaylan and revolutionary leader, to further heal Dagohoy's wounds. While performing the ritual of renewal and baptizing the new resistance fighters, the Friar saw the traditional baptism. He disapproves and challenges Tamblot, leading to a fight. After some time, while still constantly visited by the 'spirit,' the revolutionaries prepare for a significant uprising led by Dagohoy. Their battle cry for justice signals the beginning of 85 years of revolution.",

Outnumbered by nearly 10 to 1, the platoon was blindsided by a fierce attack. The triple-canopy jungle was dense and the terrain muddy, making rescue all but impossible.\r The film is a journey to understand what the filmmaker's father and seven survivors went through in 1966, and what they continue to go through today. Some volunteered for the army as teenagers. Others were drafted. Some went back to Vietnam years later with the hope of finding closure and peace.",

But just at the moment when we begin to believe in the correctness and invulnerability of the hero, real tests begin for him. Yura learns that his grandfather is in the hospital because he saw his enemy during the Great Patriotic War in a report from Latvia about the parade in honor of the SS. Now the hero does not doubt for a moment that it is he who must restore justice and arrange a meeting between his grandfather and SS Untersturmführer Alfred Weber. To do this, he again has to move from words to deeds. Broken fists, cars and the hero's heart - and that's not all that he will have to face on the way to Europe.",

Allegedly he had committed suicide on 9 May 1945. Yet, recently found documents contradict the official version. Kammler controlled a widespread network of underground production sites vital to the German war effort. But Kammler was not merely in charge of the latest state of the art weapons technology. The former architect and civil engineer was also one of the key figures behind the construction of concentration camps and the systematic employment of their inmates as forced laborers. In the end, he escaped being charged as a war criminal at the Nuremberg trials.",

It became the mission of a group of American pilots to stop the Nazis from unleashing their maniacal plot, knowing that failure was not an option.",

On June 6th, 1944, Allied soldiers attack German positions at no less than five sectors of the beach in Normandy. The assault takes place from the sea and is considered the largest amphibious landing operation in history. This event now sees its 80th anniversary.  But so close, so authentic, this battle has never been shown before. American and British cameramen are at the scene in landing boats, under fire at the beaches, and during the rescue of wounded soldiers. Their original footage, shoot in black-and-white, was extensively restored and colourized for this documentary. The historically unique footage appear in motion picture quality. The war gets colour. And thereby a different impact. We look directly in the faces of those, Americans, Canadians, Britons, and Germans, who are often not older than 20. In “24h D-Day”, they tell about their D-Day, the day they never can forget.",

In the summer of 1944, 168 airmen from the US, England, Canada and other Allied countries were captured in Paris by the German Gestapo and sent to the infamous \"Koncentration Lager Buchenwald\" in Germany. Falsely accused of being \"terrorists and saboteurs,\" the airmen faced a terrifying fight for survival and a race against time to escape their execution. A controversial moment in history that their home countries tried to hush-up, Lost Airmen of Buchenwald tells this harrowing story through interviews with seven surviving members of the group, including their heroic commanding officer. The film follows them from their days hiding with the French Resistance to the darkest corners of the Holocaust, where they struggled to survive as Germany collapsed under the weight of the advancing Russian and Allied armies",

From a chance visit to the Pentagon, to growing up in a vibrant integrated neighborhood, his story is one of resilience and inspiration. Fueled by the determination to seize educational opportunities, he enlists just in time to experience the racial divisions of his era before Truman desegregates the military. Thrust into the brutality of the Korean War, the weight of combat becomes an indelible part of his soul. Returning home, he embarks on a new path as an architect and discovers unexpected connections in far-off Pakistan. As his family expands, his sons reflect on the man who raised them and the legacy he instilled. This film unearths the essence of the Black experience in the early 20th century, paints a vivid portrait of the Chosin Reservoir, and unravels the intricate tapestry of race, family, and personal growth.",

Through flashbacks and the sharing of memories, we witness the love story between Adrianna, a dedicated OSI agent, and her wife, Heather, as they navigate the challenges of military life under the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. Despite the constant fear of exposure, their bond grows stronger. Adrianna's eventual deployment to Afghanistan, where she serves with valor, ends tragically, leaving her family to grapple with the devastating news. The narrative captures the enduring love and strength that Adrianna instilled in her family, her commitment to her duty, and the bittersweet reality of their shared dreams cut short. The film closes with a reflection on the end of America's military involvement in Afghanistan, juxtaposing personal loss with historical milestones, and a message of gratitude and resilience for the future.",
