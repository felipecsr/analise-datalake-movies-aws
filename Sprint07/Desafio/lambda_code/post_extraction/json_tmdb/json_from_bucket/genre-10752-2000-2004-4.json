        "overview": "Todorovsky's film examines life in a provincial Russian town (that is too small to even appear on the map) just outside of Stalingrad during the famous WWII Battle. This is NOT a traditional war film, and the epic events of the battle take place almost entirely off screen. Instead, Todorovsky outlines a crude love triangle between three young people caught up in the harsh Russian winter. The stark winter settings, and the characters' struggle for survival, are what make this film one worth watching.",

Prime among these is orphan girl Jiyan (Pirsheng Berzinji), and her lively young cousin Sherko (Choman Hawrami).

Thirteen months later, Northern and Southern armies clashed again in the Second Battle of Manassas, a far larger battle that signaled the ascendancy of Confederate military prowess under the leadership of Robert E. Lee.  With its narrative sweep and stunning imagery, Manassas: End of Innocence offers audiences a glimpse into the lives of soldiers and civilians enmeshed in the turmoil of war. Shot on location in Manassas National Battlefield Park and within the surrounding community, the film showcases such landmark features of the battlefield landscape as the Stone House and the Stone Bridge over Bull Run and recreates key scenes from both battles.",

With aid supplied by the United States, El Salvadoran soldiers ravaged the countryside, killing 75,000 civilians -- many of them women and children.  In 1989, the horrific murder of six Jesuit priests and two women shocked the world into action.  Following the U.S. investigation into the atrocity, ENEMIES OF WAR reveals the stories of people embarking on a seemingly impossible path to peace in a country suffering from war.",

BattleGround is an irreverent journey that will challenge the orthodoxies of Left and Right, and highlight the humanity of all sides of the conflict. BattleGround will be a critical film for anyone who wants to understand the powerful forces that are sucking America deeper and deeper into a Middle Eastern quagmire. Is Iraq our generation's \"Bright Shining Lie,\" or is it the frontline in a global battle for national survival? Or is to some combination of both?",

'What do you want me to say?' asks one bluff veteran. Shame and defiance rub shoulders. 'I won't be allowed in heaven,' notes one rueful conscript. Occasionally Kedar hits on the madness; the game of it; the sick decorum. They're meant to shoot at the arms and legs of the stone throwers. 'I used to say I was responsible for a lot of legless Palestinians,' proffers a soldier. 'I would never say that now.'",

Millions of these 'cluster bombs' did not explode when dropped, leaving the country massively contaminated with 'bombies' as dangerous now as when they fell 30 years ago. Bombies examines the problem of unexploded cluster bombs through the personal experiences of a group of Laotians and foreigners and argues for their elimination as a weapon of war. Unfortunately they are still a standard part of the US arsenal and were dropped in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq.",

        "overview": "Guernika, year 1937. The city is savagely bombed from the air by a battalion of fascist troops. During the bombardment, Republican artillery shoots down an Italian plane. The pilot manages to parachute very close to a village inhabited by three women. Badly wounded on the ground, he is going to be finished off by one of them, Ikerne. This one, however, feels disturbed by the man's presence, and in a purely impulsive act she decides to take him to the house's barn. The presence of the man in the house reveals the lethargic desire of the three women. But it will also bring out the small conflicts and contradictions that the harsh survival conditions in the house have generated. The solution finds its way between desire for man and hatred for the enemy.",
