However, the fact that the killer left a music box with the lullaby \"Hush Little Baby\" at the crime scene does not lead to a clear solving. 25 years later, the investigative journalist Stefanie Schneider, known as \"Mütze\", made a surprising discovery in Cologne. In a disused multi-storey car park, she films an undressed corpse of a man with a music box running next to it! When her colleague Jan Römer, who reported on the spectacular Sonja case as a young journalist in 1995, recognizes the melody from back then, he immediately believes there is a connection. He goes to Wilzenberg with his ambitious colleague to interview Sonja's mother Maria, her former teacher Waldheim and her best friends. The more the journalists compile, the clearer the contradictions and gaps that the investigators should have noticed at the time.",

Wallat takes over the management of an LKA team that monitors the potential repeat offender. His \"unofficial\" assignment does not fit into any service manual: Wallat is supposed to catch Hagenow in the act - in good time, of course - in order to put him behind bars forever. Meanwhile, the ex-convict moves into a room in the house of the idealistic village pastor Berkenbusch and starts a job at the local sawmill. The LKA team serves him around the clock. When Wallat loses sight of him during a night walk, a nightmare begins the next morning: Max, the eight-year-old son of Berkenbusch's housekeeper, has disappeared without a trace",
