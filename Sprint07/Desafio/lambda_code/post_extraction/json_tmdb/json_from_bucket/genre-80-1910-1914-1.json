The hero of this film is a female spy, an acrobatic Mata-Hari, played by his favorite actress, Josette Andriot, who wore a characteristic costume of a close-fitting black jersey, two years before Musidora achieved cult status with her similar appearance as Irma Vep. This final masterpiece reflects Jasset's popular style: rhythmic action, fantastic realism, rich visuals, an anarchistic philosophy, a disdain for psychology, and an attention to lighting that earned him the nickname “the Rembrandt of the cinema\". Although Jasset died shortly after completion, the film had considerable success and Andriot went on to make four more films in the series with other directors.",

        "overview": "From Rotterdam, Gerhard Bern has received the terrible news that, for no ostensible reason, his brother has committed suicide. The only clue seems to be his membership of a secret club. To find an explanation, Gerhard, accompanied by a detective, hurries to Rotterdam, where he is given accommodation by Consul Verstraaten, a friend of his father. There he meets and falls in love with the Consul’s daughter Ilse and shortly thereafter they become engaged. In the meantime another mysterious suicide has been reported. It appears that in both cases the men, both members of the same club, had taken out a life insurance policy and that a certain Mr van Gelderen, leader of the club, has collected the insurance money.",

        "overview": "Winthrop Clavering a mystery writer, is continually ridiculed for the fiction of the crimes he depicts, so he decides to solve a case himself. To that end, he determines to find the slayer of Pedro Alvarez, who whispered before dying that his assailant was a woman. At the City Refuge for Homeless Girls, Clavering obtains the assistance of Margaret Holt, the sister of Victor Holt, the district attorney. Margaret, it is revealed, was abducted by Juanita, a member of a gang of white slavers led by Alvarez. After escaping from a brothel, Margaret became Alvarez' stenographer, hoping to gather secret information on his gang. While searching for evidence, Margaret was surprised by Alvarez, whom she killed. Finally, Clavering captures the gang, clears Margaret, and encourages her romance with cub reporter Jack Howell. This film is presumably lost.",
